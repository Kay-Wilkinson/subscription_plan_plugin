# subscription_plan_plugin
A (Stripe) payment plan service for SAAS or Ecommerce websites

This is a basic Stripe integration for a tiered, monthly subscription service, useful for many SAAS platforms
or Ecommerce websites. The plugin is easy to modify to include other payment options such as one-off payments
(more useful for Ecommerce applications) or graduated pricing options.

This repo is by no means a production ready plugin. It is merely an excersise into intergrating subscription services
into a Django application.
